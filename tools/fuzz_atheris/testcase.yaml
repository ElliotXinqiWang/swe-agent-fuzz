target_function:
  description: "A buggy integer sorting function that is supposed to return a non-decreasing list."
  signature_hint: "buggy_sort(nums: list[int]) -> list[int]"

issue_description:
  natural_language: >
    The function is intended to sort the input list of integers in non-decreasing
    order, but there is a corner-case bug. For some inputs, especially when the
    smallest element should be moved to the first position, the result is not
    properly sorted.

input_description:
  natural_language: >
    The input is a Python list of integers. The fuzzer should generate lists
    of various lengths (including empty lists and single-element lists) and
    with various values: positive numbers, negative numbers, zeros, duplicates,
    already sorted lists, and reverse-sorted lists. The list length should be
    reasonably small (for example between 0 and 20 elements), but the distribution
    of values should be diverse enough to reveal sorting corner cases.

pre_condition:
  natural_language: >
    The function should accept any Python list of integers without crashing.
    It should handle empty lists, very small lists, and lists with repeated
    or negative values. No matter what integers appear in the list, the function
    must not raise unexpected exceptions.

post_condition:
  natural_language: >
    The returned list must be the same length as the input list, must contain
    exactly the same multiset of integers as the input (no elements added,
    removed, or changed), and must be sorted in non-decreasing order
    (each element is less than or equal to the next one). If any of these
    conditions is violated, the post-condition should be considered false.
